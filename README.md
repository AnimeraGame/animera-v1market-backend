## Prisma Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install [Nestjs CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages) to start and [generate CRUD resources](https://trilon.io/blog/introducing-cli-generators-crud-api-in-1-minute)

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Install the dependencies for the Nest application:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Prisma Migrate

[Prisma Migrate](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/tree/master/docs/prisma-migrate) is used to manage the schema and migration of the database. Prisma datasource requires an environment variable `DATABASE_URL` for the connection to the PostgreSQL database. Copy [prisma/example.env](prisma/example.env) and rename to `.env`. If you made any updates to the PostgreSQL variables (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` `POSTGRES_DB`), please update them in your [prisma/.env](prisma/.env) file which is used by Prisma Migrate and for seeding the database.

Use Prisma Migrate in your [development environment](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-preview-b5eno5g08d0b#evolving-the-schema-in-development) to

1. Creates `migration.sql` file
2. Updates Database Schema
3. Generates Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
# or
npm run migrate:dev
```

If you like to customize your `migration.sql` file run the following command. After making your customizations run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply it.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only
# or
npm run migrate:dev:create
```

If you are happy with your database changes you want to deploy those changes to your [production database](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-preview-b5eno5g08d0b#applying-migrations-in-production-and-other-environments). Use `prisma migrate deploy` to apply all pending migrations, can also be used in CI/CD pipelines as it works without prompts.

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
# or
npm run migrate:deploy
```

### 4. Prisma: Prisma Client JS

[Prisma Client JS](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/api) is a type-safe database client auto-generated based on the data model.

Generate Prisma Client JS by running

> **Note**: Every time you update [schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma) re-generate Prisma Client JS

```bash
npx prisma generate
# or
npm run prisma:generate
```

### 5. Seed the database data with this script

Execute the script with this command:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### 6. Start NestJS Server

Run Nest Server in Development mode:

```bash
npm run start

# watch mode
npm run start:dev
```

Run Nest Server in Production mode:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

GraphQL Playground for the NestJS Server is available here: http://localhost:3000/graphql

**[⬆ back to top](#overview)**

## GraphQL Playground

Open up the [example GraphQL queries](graphql/auth.graphql) and copy them to the GraphQL Playground. Some queries and mutations are secured by an auth guard. You have to acquire a JWT token from `signup` or `login`. Add the `accessToken`as followed to **HTTP HEADERS** in the playground and replace `YOURTOKEN` here:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer YOURTOKEN"
}
```

## Rest Api

[RESTful API](http://localhost:3000/api) documentation available with Swagger.

## Schema Development

Update the Prisma schema `prisma/schema.prisma` and after that run the following two commands:

```bash
npx prisma generate
# or in watch mode
npx prisma generate --watch
# or
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:generate:watch
```

## NestJS - Api Schema

The [schema.graphql](./src/schema.graphql) is generated with [code first approach](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start#code-first). The schema is generated from the [models](./src/models/user.ts), the [resolvers](./src/resolvers/auth/auth.resolver.ts) and the [input](./src/resolvers/auth/dto/login.input.ts) classes.

You can use [class-validator](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/validation) to validate your inputs and arguments.

### Resolver

To implement the new query, a new resolver function needs to be added to `users.resolver.ts`.

```ts
@Query(returns => User)
async getUser(@Args() args): Promise<users> {
  return await this.prisma.client.user(args);
}
```

Restart the NestJS server and this time the Query to fetch a `user` should work.

## GraphQL Client

A GraphQL client is necessary to consume the GraphQL api provided by the NestJS Server.

Checkout [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) a popular GraphQL client which offers several clients for React, Angular, Vue.js, Native iOS, Native Android and more.
